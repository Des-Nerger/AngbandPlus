=== Creating a Character ===

Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a character
in the world of Angband.  Perhaps the most important thing you control is the
birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be chosen various
attributes that will affect the future life of your character.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices
as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play, followed by
a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a random character
matching the appropriate constraints.

Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you have
generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth between
the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a personality
that you feel comfortable with.

You may start the entire process over at any time.

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character.  In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself.  For example,
on some machines, the chatacter name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk.  On others, the character name specifies
special "pref" files.  And the character name is used on the high score list.


=== Character Characteristics ===

Each character has a class, that is chosen before the character is generated,
and which will stay fixed for the entire life of that character.  Class has
many effects, which will be mentioned as they come up.

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height and weight, which are
randomly determined, but which are affected by the sex of the character.

Each character also has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the abilities of the
character in a variety of ways.  
Every stat has a numerical value, ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal
maximum of 18, and even higher, into the "percentile" range, represented as
"18/01" through "18/100": this is the maximum that can be achieved
intrinsically, for any given stat. If the character is started with the option
of "maximize effect of race/class bonuses" (from the Birth Options menu, and
this is set as "on" by default), the maximum figure of 18/100 is further
adjusted by the adjustments for class.  
Equipment may add bonuses or penalties to this, and raise the player's stats
beyond the normal intrinsic limits: the stats may go as high as they like, with
the right choice of equipment, but the effects of having higher stats largely
stop at 18/200.

Each character also has several primary "skills", disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, fighting skill,
and shooting skill, which are derived from the character's class, level, stats,
and current equipment.  These skills have rather obvious effects, but will be
described more completely below.

Each character has experience, which increases as the character becomes more
experienced, and a level, which is based on experience, and also on class.  As
the experience rises, so does the level, and as the level rises, certain other
abilities and characteristics rise as well.  Deep down inside, the real
objective of the game is to increase your experience, and certain other
characteristics, and also to collect useful items, to give you a decent chance
against Morgoth.  Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your
level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher level.
Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical means, or by simply
regaining the experience all over again.

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it hidden in
the dungeon.  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which
is based on the characters social class (higher is better), charisma (higher
is better), and other stats (less powerful characters start with more gold).  
Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which may be kept, 
or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold. However, especially valuable items
will never sell for the full price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that 
he is prepared to pay for any item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy 
your items for up to 30,000 gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and 
will pay no more than 5,000.

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character can
avoid damage.  The armor class is affected by dexterity and the equipment. 
Armor class on equipment is always denoted in [square brackets], usually as 
a figure of [X,+Y] where X is the intrinsic AC of the armor in question, and 
Y is the magical bonus to armor class provided by that item.

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the character can
sustain before he dies.  The maximum number of hit points is derived from your
race, class, level, and constitution, and you can never have more hit points
than the maximum.  Hit points may be regained by a variety of means.

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many spells
(or prayers) a character can cast (or pray).  The maximum number of spell
points is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or
wisdom (for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the
maximum.  Spell points may be regained by a variety of means.


=== Classes and Skills ===
 
 
          Skills
            Passive skill
              These skills provide a bonus which continuously affects the
              character. They cannot be activated, and are not shown in the 'm'
              skill list.
            Attack skill
              An attack must be targetted at an adjacent monster, hits once,
              and uses the character's second weapon only if there is no weapon
              in the normal weapon slot.
            Spell
              Spells use mana to cast, and can have many different effects.
            Aura
              Auras affect the character while they are active. They can be
              activated and de-activated by choosing them from the 'm' skill
              list. An aura may have a mana cost per turn (and it ends when the
              character does not have enough mana left to continue it), or a
              mana cost each time it does something, or no cost at all. Only
              one aura can be active at any time, and selecting a different
              aura ends the current aura. Changing auras does not take any
              time.
            Charge up skill
              Attacking with a charge-up skill active adds bouses and different
              effects to finishing moves, but costs mana, and stops when the
              character has accumulated 3 'charges' (the maximum) of the type
              which the skill provides. Studying a charge-up skill increases
              the chance that the character can hold on to these 'charges' for
              longer, as well as increasing their effect on finishing moves.
              Changing charge-up skills does not take any time.
              Attacking normally with no charge-up skills active counts as a
              finishing move, albeit with no added bonuses which finishing move
              skills provide.
            Finishing move
              These are attack skills (see Attack skill above) available to the
              assasin, which have various effects and also benefit from
              charge-up skills.
              A normal attack made with no charge-up skills active is
              considered to be a finishing move, and therefore also benefits
              from charge-up skills.
            Shapeshift
              Shapeshifting always takes mana to activate, ends after a certain
              period of time (this time can be increased by Druids with the
              Lycanthropy skill), and cannot be de-activated except by
              activating a different shapeshift.
              Some druid skills require a certain shape to be worn before they
              can be used.

          Barbarian
            Barbarians are able to wield any two (non-claw type) weapons at
            once.

            Sword/Polearm/Hafted/Axe Mastery (passive, level 1)
               These skills give a bonus to hit and damage per skill level,

            Double Swing (attack, level 6)
                Quickly attacks once with each weapon (two must be wielded to

            Stun (attack, level 6)
               Attack a monster and if attack hits, stun the monster, but do
               less damage than normal. Stun duration and damage increase as
               this skill is studied. Uses second weapon only if one exists and
               there is nothing in first weapon slot.
            Berserk (spell, level 6)
               Enter a berserk rage which grants bonuses to hit and damage but
               penalizes AC. Duration and effectiveness increase as this skill

            Frenzy (aura, level 24, requires Double Swing and Increased Speed)
               While this aura is active, successful hits may add to movement
               and attack speed while costing a small amount of mana. This
               skill is similar to an Assasin's charge-up skill, but it can
               grant up to 5 charges, and the bonuses gained from it
               continuously affect the character, but decrease over time.

             Glacial Spike (spell, level 12, requires Frostbolt)
                A bolt of ice and a ball of frost, cast simultaneously.
             Thunderstorm (aura, level 24, requires Lightning)
                While this aura is active, the sorceress is calling down
                lightning bolts to strike one or more randomly chosen monsters
                each turn (which must be in line-of-sight). It ends
                automatically when the sorceress runs out of mana.
             Blizzard (aura, level 24, requires Glacial Spike)
                While this aura is active, the sorceress is calling down a hail
                of cold and ice, which has a chance to strike each monster in
                line-of-sight with either cold or ice. It ends automatically
                when the sorceress runs out of mana.
             Fire Mastery (passive, level 30, requires Firebolt)
                Boosts the damage of sorceress spells that do fire damage.

                Can attack monsters effectively without a weapon. Damage done
                and attacks per turn are increased at this skill is studied,
                and the druid also gets a damage bonus from shapeshifts with
                claws unless they are wearing gloves. Wearing a shield reduces
                the number of times an attack can be made each turn.
             Sunray (spell, level 1)
                Lights the nearby area (radius increases as skill is studied)
                and fires a ray of light, does damage to light-sensitive
                monsters.
             Lycanthropy (passive, level 1, requires at least one shapeshift)
                This skill increases the duration of any shapeshift the druid
                may use, and the amount of hitpoints the druid has while
                shifted.
             Werewolf (shapeshift, level 1)
                Grants bonuses to damage and speed (both movement and attack

                form.
             Feral Rage (spell, level 12, requires Werewolf)
                Enter a wild rage which grants bonuses to hit and damage but
                penalizes AC. Duration and effectiveenss increase as this skill
                is studied. The rage can only be used while in werewolf form,
                and ends as soon as werewolf form is left.
             Shockwave (spell, level 24, requires Werebear)
                Causes a stunning earthquake. Radius of the earthquake, number
                of squares effected within that radius, and duration of
                stunning increase as this skill is studied. This skill can only
                be used while in Werebear form.
 
          Assasin
             Assasins are able to wield two claw type weapons at once. These
             include katars, cesti, wrist spikes and blades, and blade talons.

             Claw Mastery (passive, level 1)
               This skill gives a bonus to hit and damage per skill level, with
               claw type weapons.

                the potential damage of each kick.
             Dragon Claws (finishing move, level 6)
                Quickly attacks once with each claw weapon (two must be wielded

                Jabs the target with amazon's wielded polearm a number of
                times, but stops as soon as the amazon misses. Each jab after
                the first is slightly less poweful. Studying this skill allows
                more jabs and increases the damage of each jab.
             Magic Ammunition (spell, level 1)
                Creates and fires an unerringly accurate magical arrow, bolt or
                shot from the archer's currently equipped missile

             Prayer (aura, level 6)
                Draws life from surroundings to heal the paladin. This aura
                costs mana whenever it heals the paladin, and ends

                For a small mana cost, use you shield to bash and possibly stun
                a monster. Does not automatically hit. If the paladin also has
                the Holy Shield skill, does more damage to evil monsters, which
                increases as Holy Shield is studied.
             Holy Shield (passive, level 24)
                Gives a bonus to AC from worn shields, and protection from evil
                (while wearing a shield), which increases in effectiveness as

                This aura damages evil monsters that can see the paladin, and
                costs mana each time it hurts a monster (and ends automatically
                when the paladin runs out of mana). While it is active, it also
                grants the paladin permanent light, which increases in radius
                as this skill is studied.

          Necromancer
             Teeth (spell, level 1)

                killing living monsters which are not stupid or cold-blooded. 
                The amount gained depends on the monster's level and how much 
                this skill has been studied.
             Terror (aura, level 24)
                This aura has a chance to scare any monster which can see the

             Lethargy (aura, level 24)
                This aura reduces the speed of nearby monstes, and costs mana
                each time it affects a monster, and ends automatically when the
                necromancer runs out of mana.

=== Stats ===

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
               combat.  A high strength can improve your chances of hitting
               as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
               acters with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength
               is also useful in tunnelling and in carrying heavy items.
 
          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects the mana of mage-like
               spellcasters, sorceresses, archers and assasins.  A good
               intelligence can also help with using magic devices, picking
               locks, and disarming traps.
 
          Wisdom
               Wisdom affects the mana of priest-like spellcasters, berserkers,
               druids and paladins.  A good wisdom can also help to improve
               your chances of resisting magical spells cast upon you by
               monsters.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
               dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
               lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and
               will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and
               dodging blows from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in
               picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from
               some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if 
               the character has a high enough dexterity, thieves will
               never be successful in stealing from the player.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
               character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting.
 
          Charisma
               Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
               appearance.  A character with a high charisma will receive
               better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
               very low charisma may be robbed blind. 
 

=== Abilities (outdated) ===

          Characters possess some different abilities which can  help  them
          to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon
          race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low  stats,
          and may increase with the level of the character.
 
          Fighting
               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
               fists.  Normally  a  character  gets  a single blow from any
               weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are  high  enough,
               he  may  receive  more blows per round with lighter weapons.
               Strength and dexterity both modify the  ability  to  hit  an
               opponent.  This skill increases  with the level of the char-
               acter.
 
          Shooting Ability
               Using  ranged  missile  weapons  (and  throwing  objects) is
               included  in this skill.  Different stats apply to different
               weapons, but this ability may modify the distance an  object
               is  thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability
               to hit a creature.  This skill increases with the  level  of
               the character.
 
          Saving Throws
               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  the
               effects  of  a spell cast on him by another person/creature.
               This does not include spells cast on the player by  his  own
               stupidity,  such  as  quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability
               increases with the level of the  character,  but  then  most
               high  level  creatures  are  better at casting spells, so it
               tends to even out.  A high wisdom also increases this  abil-
               ity.
 
          Stealth
               The ability to move  silently about is very useful.  Charac-
               ters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
               gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to  notice
               a  stealthy  character  entirely, allowing a player to avoid
               certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race  and
               class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
          Disarming
               Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  and
               includes  picking  locks  on  traps and doors.  A successful
               disarming will gain the character  some experience.  A  trap
               must  be  found  before  it  can be disarmed.  Dexterity and
               intelligence both modify the ability  to  disarm,  and  this
               ability increases with the level of the character.
 
          Magical Devices
               Using a magical device such as  a  wand  or  staff  requires
               experience  and  knowledge.  Spell  users such as  magi  and
               priests are therefore much better at using a magical  device
               than say a warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence,
               and increases with the level of the character.

          Searching Frequency (Perception)
               Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  without
               actively  seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon
               race and class, and  will  never  improve  unless  magically
               enhanced.

          Searching Ability (Searching)
               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
               and  traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but
               magi,  rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill
               is  based  entirely  upon  race  and  class,  and will never
               improve unless magically enhanced.



=== Miscellaneous (outdated) ===


          Infra-vision
               Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of
               the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the
               player to see walls and objects.  Infra-vision will allow a
               character to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a cer- tain
               distance.  This ability works equally well with or with out a
               light source.  However, many of Angband's creatures are
               cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light
               source.  Humans can gain infra-vision only if it is magically
               enhanced.
