Diabloband 0.0.1

Removed races for both player and shopkeepers
Sex depends on class, not shown
Changed class names to Barbarian, Sorceress, Druid, Assasin, Amazon and Paladin
Added Necromancer class
Removed class titles
Removed spellcasting and spell books
Changed starting equipment, no gold at birth, gets 4 cure lights wounds, 1 
identify, and 1 word of recall, amazons get arrows, and all starting 
equipment is 99% off
Moved spell stat and max spell weight to class info
All classes get mana, only sorceress is encumbered by gloves, barbarian and
paladin are not encumbered by heavy equipment
Attributes, hp and mana are set by class and no longer random
HP and Mana get a base value from class, and increase a set amount as level and
the relevent stat increases (Con for hp, Int or Wis for mana)
Removed auto-roller, point-based, and maximize options - at atts have natural
max of 18/100
Charaters need twice as much XP to advance, classes do not differ in XP penalty
Changed character information screen, changed how melee and missile damage is
shown, added an XP bar, put info on used stat points where race bonus was
Added mana and health bars
Added display of remaining stat/skill points to main screen

Added percentile resistances for acid, electricity, fire, cold and poison. Max
from items is 75% and max from items + temporary resistance (bonus of 33%) is
90%. Items that granted immunity now grant a +100% bonus, resistance from most
items is 25% per item, rings of element (Flames, Ice, etc) and single-element
dragon scale mail (Black, Red, etc) give 40%, items that provide resistance to
more than one element give 20% to each

Cold now slows the target, player can resist the effects with cold resistance,
monsters immune to cold are not affected

Can now increase (practice) attributes with 'p', gets 1 stat point per
level after level 1
Doubled the rarity of stat potions

Can now study skills with 'G', gets 1 skill point at level 1 and 2 skill
points per level after that
Enabled looking at skills for next level with 'G' even if no skills points
Skills may require a certain XP level, or other skills, before they can be
learnt
Cannot advance a skill past a skill level of current XP level + 1 - level
required to first study the skill. So you can max a level 1 skill at XP level
20, but you have to wait till XP level 49 to max a skill that requires level 30
Cannot advance a skill past skill level 20
Can use non-passive skills with 'm' - these can cost mana and take time to use

Added auras - can be activated and deactivated by selecting them from skill
list. An aura may have a mana cost and duration (but character can choose to
end it before the aura times out), or a mana cost per turn (and it ends when
the character does not have enough mana left to continue it), or a mana cost
each time it affects a monster, or no cost at all. Only one aura can be active
at any time, and selecting a different aura ends the current aura
Changing auras does not take any time

Added shapeshifts - cost mana to activate, end after a certain period of time,
cannot be deactivated except by choosing a different shapeshift
While active, grant various bonuses
Lycanthropy skill grants a druid more hp while shapeshifted, and extends the
duration of the shapeshift
Added druid skills which require a certain form to be known before they can be
learnt, and the form to be worn before they can be used
Druids using unarmed combat get a small bonus from wolf/bear claws unless
wearing gloves, and a small bonus from gauntlets or spiked/metal-shod boots (to
all blows, irrelevant of whether message is 'you punch' or 'you kick')

Active auras and shapeshifts are shown on main screen

Added charge-up skills and finishing moves for assasins
Attacking with a charge-up skill active adds bouses and different effects to
finishing moves, but costs mana, and stops when the character has accumulated 3
'charges' (the maximum) of the type which the skill provides. Studying a
charge-up skill increases the chance that the character can hold on to these
'charges' for longer, as well as increasing their effect on finishing moves.
Changing charge-up skills does not take any time.
Finishing moves are attack skills available to the assasin, which have various
effects and also benefit from charge-up skills. Attacking normally with no
charge-up skills active counts as a finishing move.
Added display of current charges about health and mana bars

If studying                     If using                           Color
and skill is maxed                                                 light red
                                an active aura or shapeshift       light green
and skill can be studied        and skill is useable               white
and not high enough XP level                                       dark red
and pre-requisites are not met  and mana/requirements not met      dark red

When studying skills, information shown is for the next skill level up rather
than the current level
Don't always show information about skill's effectiveness, but do show reason
for not being able to study or use a skill

Resting no longer regenerates hp unless player has regeneration intrinstic
Resting is randomly interrupted 1 in 5000 times, as it is not so effective now
and so uses up more food and light fuel
Slow regeneration rate down, hp gains 1 around every 10 turns, mana regenerates
very slowly (but Warmth skill increases this)
Increased rarity and value of regeneration on ego-items and randarts
Added restore light/serious/critical mana potions
Changed effect of healing items and mana potions - now they cure gradually over
time, amount to be cured shown in gray *'s in health/mana bars (heroism,
berserk strength, restore mana and rejuvenation potions still take effect
instantly)
Heal hp and restore mana when gaining a level

Limited size of stacks of items - junk items, spikes and ammo remain at 99,
potions, scrolls, amulets, rings, flasks, and food except rations and waybread
to 20, empty bottles, rations, waybread and torches to 10, and nothing else can
stack

Added a command to show the time of day (control-T)
If below level 50, show XP needed to advance to next level
Added Quiver slot

Changed how damage bonus affects weapons and ammo - it now adjusts the number
of sides of each dice. A weapon with 1d5 + 3 which did an average of *2 damage
previously now does 1d10 damage.
Bows no longer get a damage bonus/penalty.
Around 1/4 weapons have no to-hit adjustment, but double the damage adjustment.
Added two weapon combat - assasins can wield two claw type weapons at a time,
barbarians can wield two non-claw weapons at a time. Blows (but not extra
attacks, which only affect enchanted weapon) are divided between hands
Cannot wield a non-ok weapon if an ok weapon is in second slot
When wielding an ok weapon with one already wielded, can choose whether to dual
wield, if yes, then second weapon replaces shield (if any), if no then swap
weapons normally
Druid's unarmed blows are divided between hands for prettiness
Show both hands in character information display, monster memory calculates
average damage from both weapons 
Barbarian weapon masteries and assasins claw masteries only apply to relevant
weapon

Added two-handed weapons, cannot wield if already wielding something in shield
slot, cannot wear shield if wielding a two-handed weapon
Includes weapons heavier than 20lbs, and also Mage Staff, Quarterstaff, Beaked
Axe, Glaive, Halberd, Awl-Pike, Pike

Attacking stops when monster dies (ie if not all available blows were used)
and only takes time for each blow that was actually used

Added some new flavours from Sangband
Added new items, added them to randart code, added effects of timed telepathy,
protection from undead, detect undead, detect animals
Added ego-items for rings/amulets, (Glowing) or (Indestructible)
Added skill items - grants a bonus to one skill, does not affect studying
of skills
Added skill items that grant bonuses to more than one skill

Added TV_AXE, increased max tvals of ego-items to 4
Added TV_CLAW, claw weapons for assasins, can be dual-wielded by assasins
without penalty
Skeletons (the items) now appear as 's' instead of '~'
Cumulative lite
Temporary infravision has radius 5 (since it cannot be gained via race)
Potions of life will now restore stats before healing to provide full health
even if CON was drained

Rearranged items in stores, changed Alchemist to Gambling Den
Gambling Den generates unknown, random items whenever entered. Cost depends on
max recall depth, there are no discounts. Only ammunition comes in large
piles. Items must be bought as a pile (no buying just one to ID the rest), are
identified when purchase is complete
Quality of items in Black Market depends on recall depth
Stores stock a range of random items whose depth depends on recall depth
Examining an item in the home displayed the item as if it was identified, even
if it wasn't
Fade out price of items in stores if they're not affordable

Rods show how many more turns are left till they can be used again
Inform player when rods and artifacts recharge, update charging
rods/artifacts in inven windows
When 'I'nspecting artifacts and magical devices (wands, staffs, rods), chance
to activate or use the item is described (only if activation is known, or type
of device is known). (calculation is from sCthangband)

Items are always psuedo-id'd, average items are always known, changed good to
magic (weapons with only damage dice changed (due to a damage bonus/penalty)
are average), excellent to rare and special to unique
Identify does *identify*, no more *identify* scrolls, *enlightenment* no longer
id's items
Cannot equip unidentified items
Show no information about unidentified weapons and armour
Show only information about weapons/equipment that differs from the norm,
ie base AC for armour, damage dice for weapons, pval for diggers and multiplier
for bows
Changed format of melee weapons and missiles from (2d5) (+5, +5) to (+5, 2d5+5)
Show extra might in multiplier of missile launcher
Removed discounts

Changed message when attacking monsters to 'you punch it' if no weapon is
wielded, druids using unarmed combat get 'you kick it' half the time
In monster memory, changed 'it has a liferating of x' to 'it takes an average
of x blows and y shots to kill' (based on known weapon damage, but not brands
or slays)
Also added colored info to monster memory
Groups of monsters are scattered
Increased chance per round of creating a new monster
Dungeon size is smaller at shallower depths (idea from Randomband, code
from Ey)
