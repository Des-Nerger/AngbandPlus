Further Hacks Still and Other Variants: Many Authors

For a particular variant, choose the branch named after it

To download source code for (for example) PsiAngband 1.0.7 from Github:
1. Choose branch PsiAngband
2. Select 'Commits'
3. Select 'Browse code' from next to PsiAngband 1.0.7 in the list
4. Select the ZIP button (note that the download will have a silly name)

To compare two releases:
1. Choose the branch of the variant the first release is from
2. Select 'Commits'
3. Record the SHA1 hash (jumble of letters and numbers) for the release you want
4. Repeat 1 to 3 for the second release
5. If the first hash is xxxxx, and the second yyyyy, go to the URL
